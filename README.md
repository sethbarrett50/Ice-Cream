# Ice Cream Sharing Program

Welcome to my repository containing an ice cream sharing program implemented in various programming languages. 

The program prompts the user for the number of people contributing to the ice cream fund, collects the individual contribution amounts, and calculates the total number of gallons of ice cream acquired. It then calculates the number of gallons each person is entitled to based on their contribution relative to the total, and prints this information to the screen. 

Currently, the program has been implemented in the following languages:
- C#
- CLIPS
- Python
- GoLang
- PowerShell
- Java
- C++
- Kotlin
- Racket
- 32-bit x86 Assembly
- C
- Bash
- Haskell
- Dyalog APL
- JavaScript
- TypeScript

Future implementations of the program will include:
- Batch
- ARM
- Rust
- Nim
- R
- PHP
- Ruby
- Basic
- Scratch
- Swift
- Smalltalk
- Common Lisp
- Scheme
- Perl
