# Ice Cream
## I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream!!!
### This is where I implement my basic ice cream sharing program in any new languages I learn.  Each folder is named the language in which the program is wrote
#### The program asks for the number of users who are all contributing to the ice cream fund, then collects how much each user is contributing and the total number of gallons of ice cream aquired, then calculates how many gallons of ice cream each person is to recieve based on their individual contribution comparaed to the total number of gallons acquired, and prints this to the screen.
